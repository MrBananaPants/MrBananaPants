## Hi there, I'm Joran

I'm an 18-year-old Computer Science student (first year)

- Iâ€™m currently learning Python and JavaScript.
- I made my own Flutter app (Android, iOS and Windows) to wirelessly control an ESP8266
- Right now I'm working on an macOS app [CamAlert](https://github.com/MrBananaPants/CamAlert) that notifies the user if there's a new listings available on 2dehands (the eBay of Belgium)
- Fun fact: I also do photography in my free time.
